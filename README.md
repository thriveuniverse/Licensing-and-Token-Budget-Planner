# Licensing-and-Token-Budget-Planner
A small, dependency-light web app that projects monthly LLM/API token spend per environment (Dev, Staging, Prod, or custom) from your usage assumptions and plan rates. It compares spend to per-environment budgets and triggers GREEN/AMBER/RED alerts at configurable thresholds with a clear breakdown for planning.
